## I Mod Minecraft
You might see me create [QuiltMC](https://quiltmc.org/) mods and cursed libraries!
- I respect [MinecraftForge](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge) as a project, but don't like its [lead](https://github.com/LexManos).
- I like that particular [FabricMC](https://github.com/FabricMC) [leader](https://github.com/sfPlayer1) even less so.
- I have my hopes up for [QuiltMC](https://github.com/QuiltMC), which is not even out yet!

## And I also have other misc projects
- Take a look at, for example, [my in-progress horrible package manager](https://github.com/YTG1234/pack)!
